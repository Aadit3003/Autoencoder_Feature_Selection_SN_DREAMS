# Autoencoder-based Feature Selection for Diabetic Retinopathy Risk Factors
This project was done under the guidance of Dr. Sundaresan Raman, BITS Pilani, as part of the course CS F376 (Design Oriented Project) in the Second Semester of AY 21-22.

## Brief Description
We explored three methods to identify certain Risk factors for Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) of Primary or Secondary Importance. Of these 3 approaches, we found most success with the Autoencoder using the SN-DREAMS dataset for DR.

## Dataset
The SN-DREAMS dataset ([Dataset Link](https://github.com/Aadit3003/Diabetic-Retinopathy_Autoencoder/blob/2006d6796ba2008d573f280a57f0b5a523eb46f5/Modified.csv)) contains 13 risk factors (columns) and the 14th column as an indicator of DR. Of these 13, 4 factors are categorical, while 9 are continuous. This data is available for 1555 patients (rows). However, the data is imablanced, since rows with DR = 1 are sparse. To combat this SMOTE-ENN and standardization are used.

Furthermore, we use Expert-Labeled Primary/Secondary clusters ([File Link](https://github.com/Aadit3003/Diabetic-Retinopathy_Autoencoder/blob/2006d6796ba2008d573f280a57f0b5a523eb46f5/Actual.xlsx)) as the 'Gold-Truth' to evaluate the results from each approach.

## Attempt 1: Clustering
The first approach was simply to use K-Means Clustering (k=2, Initialization= k-means++) from the sklearn library. Further, T-SNE was also used for visualization (See below). However, nearly half the predictions were wrong and the classification didn't match the True labels.

## Attempt 2: Classification
We used a 70:30 Train-Test split and KNN classification (k=5, Minkowski Distance). We used the ROC-AUC Scores of each of the 13 features as a metric. If the score lied above a threshold, the cluster was classified as primary, else it was classified as secondary. However, 8 of the 13 predictions were incorrect.

## Attempt 3: Autoencoder

Again, we used a 70:30 Train Test split and Standard Scaler. The Autoencoder had 2 Fully Connected (Dense) layers. These were the Code layer with 7 neurons and the Output layer with 14 neurons. Ultimately, the neural network had 217 parameters in total.
